# HIV_Stats
Analysed "Global Adult HIV Prevalence Data (2024 Updated)" dataset sourced from Kaggle using Power BI, 
to show HIV prevalence, rates among adults and deaths, over a five-year period. I've used cleaned the data,
data modelled creating relationships in the data and used measures to analyse the dataset, to get the insights 
in the visuals here.
